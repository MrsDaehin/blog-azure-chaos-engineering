# Azure Chaos Engineering

This is the sample that was used in [my blog post](https://thomasvanlaere.com/posts/2020/09/chaos-engineering-on-azure/) where I decided to take a look at how to apply some Chaos Engineering principles. Since I focus on the Microsoft Azure platform, it only mades sense to have dig a little deeper into [Chaos Toolkit](https://chaostoolkit.org/) and [its extension for Azure](https://github.com/chaostoolkit-incubator/chaostoolkit-azure).

## Prerequisites

To run the PowerShell sample you will need:

- PowerShell 7.0+
- chaostoolkit 1.9.1
- chaostoolkit-reporting 0.13.0
- chaostoolkit-azure 0.10.0

This sample also includes a Visual Studio Code [DevContainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) configuration, allowing you to run this sample in a Docker container with the necessary dependencies preinstalled.
