# Azure Chaos Engineering

This is the sample that was used in [my blog post](https://thomasvanlaere.com/posts/2020/09/chaos-engineering-on-azure/) where I decided to take a look at how to apply some Chaos Engineering principles. Since I focus on the Microsoft Azure platform, it only mades sense to have dig a little deeper into [Chaos Toolkit](https://chaostoolkit.org/) and [its extension for Azure](https://github.com/chaostoolkit-incubator/chaostoolkit-azure).
